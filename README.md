# Tomato-Counter-Basic

In this project, I made a counter app that uses tomatoes to help visualize the current count number. Using the bottom buttons, you either add or subtract tomatoes from the counter.

This app was made with the REACT.js framework.

Pretty cool right? Check out my profile for more awesome projects!
